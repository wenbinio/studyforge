## 🎯 Interview Script (For Deeper Conversations)

**Use this for 1-on-1 interviews with willing participants (offer incentive like $20 gift card).**

### **Opening (5 min)**
- "Thanks for taking the time. We're researching how students study and what tools they use."
- "I'll ask about your study habits, pain points, and what would help you study better."
- "No wrong answers — just honest feedback."

### **Current Workflow (10 min)**
1. "Walk me through a typical study session. What apps do you open? What's your process?"
2. "Show me your note-taking app. How do you organize things?"
3. "Do you use flashcards? If so, how do you create them?"
4. "How do you stay focused during long study sessions?"

### **Pain Points (10 min)**
5. "What's the most frustrating part of your study routine?"
6. "Have you ever lost study progress (deleted notes, forgotten material)? Tell me about that."
7. "Do you study on your phone or tablet? Why or why not?"
8. "Have you tried to study with friends? How did that go?"

### **Feature Reactions (15 min)**
*Show mockups or describe features. Watch facial reactions.*

9. **Cloze deletion:** "Instead of Q&A flashcards, imagine fill-in-the-blank: 'The capital of {{France}} is {{Paris}}.' Useful?"
10. **Image occlusion:** "Click on a diagram to hide labels, then test yourself. Useful for anatomy?"
11. **Note linking:** "Type [[Note Title]] to link notes together, see a graph of connections. Thoughts?"
12. **AI tutor:** "Chat with AI about your notes: 'Explain this in simpler terms.' Would you use this?"
13. **Mobile app:** "Review flashcards on your phone during commute. How often would you use it?"

### **Pricing (5 min)**
14. "What study tools do you currently pay for?"
15. "Would you pay $5/month for an all-in-one app? What features would need to be included?"
16. "One-time $200 lifetime license vs. $5/month subscription — which do you prefer?"

### **Closing (5 min)**
17. "If you could wave a magic wand and create the perfect study app, what would it have?"
18. "Anything else we should know about how you study?"
19. "Can we follow up with you in 3 months to show you what we built?"

## 📊 Data Analysis Plan

### **Quantitative (Survey):**
1. **Count top-voted features** → prioritize roadmap
2. **Identify power users** (20+ hours/week) → interview them
3. **Segment by field** → law students may want different features than engineers
4. **Price sensitivity** → find optimal tier pricing

### **Qualitative (Interviews):**
1. **Identify emotional pain points** → marketing messaging
2. **Watch for workarounds** ("I use 3 apps because none do X") → integration opportunities
3. **Test feature comprehension** → is "cloze deletion" clear? Or say "fill-in-the-blank"?
4. **Observe actual workflows** → don't just ask, watch them study

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- % who say "mobile is critical" → validate Priority #1
- % who currently pay for study tools → market willingness to pay
- Most common pain point → solve this first
- Feature with most votes → quick win

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Good response:**
- 100+ survey responses
- 10+ in-depth interviews
- Clear top 3 features emerge
- Pricing validated (>50% willing to pay $5/mo)

**Red flags:**

- "Mobile is critical but I'd never use the desktop app" (build mobile first?)

---

**Next Steps After Research:**
1. Summarize findings (1-page brief)
2. Update roadmap based on data
3. Create feature specs for top 3 features
4. Build MVPs and test with power users
5. Iterate based on real usage
