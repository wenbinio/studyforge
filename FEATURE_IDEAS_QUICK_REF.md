## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Must-Have for Competitive Parity)

| # | Feature | Why It Matters | Example Competitor |
|---|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Cloud Sync & Cross-Device** | Every competitor has this. Single-device = dealbreaker | Anki, Notion, Quizlet |
| 2 | **Cloze Deletion Cards** | More efficient than Q&A. Essential for medical/legal students | Anki (most popular card type) |
| 3 | **Bidirectional Linking** | Modern note-taking paradigm. Connect knowledge | Obsidian, Roam, Notion |
| 4 | **Advanced Analytics** | Visual progress motivates. Current stats too basic | Forest, Anki stats, Duolingo |
| 5 | **Image Occlusion** | Can't study anatomy/diagrams without this | Anki Image Occlusion add-on |
| 6 | **Mobile App** | Students study everywhere. Desktop-only = limited adoption | All competitors have this |

## 🌟 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Differentiation & Unique Value)

| # | Feature | Why It Matters | Example Competitor |
|---|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 7 | **Voice Notes + AI Transcription** | Faster than typing. Capture lectures | Otter.ai, Notion audio |
| 8 | **Collaborative Features** | Social learning works. StudyForge is solo-only | Quizlet classes, Notion sharing |

| 11 | **Focus Mode++** | Website blocking, ambient sounds | Forest, Freedom.to |
| 12 | **Tagging & Filters** | Organize 100+ notes. Current flat list = messy | Notion, Obsidian tags |
| 13 | **LaTeX Math** | Essential for STEM. No equations = no math students | Obsidian, Anki LaTeX |
| 14 | **Templates** | Speed up note creation. Consistency | Notion templates |
| 15 | **Gamification** | Motivation is hard. XP, badges, streaks work | Duolingo, Forest, Habitica |
